pyHalo renders full mass distributions for substructure lensing simulations with the open source gravitational lensing software package lenstronomy (https://github.com/lenstronomy/lenstronomy). The example notebooks illustrate the core functionality of this package.

If you would like to use this package and have questions, please get in touch with me at gilmanda@uchicago.edu - I am happy to help!

Installation
------------
This code is under active developement. To get the latest version, it is recommended to install directly from github: 

"git clone https://github.com/dangilman/pyHalo.git; cd pyhalo; python -m setup.py install". 

Make sure to check the requirements listed in requirements.txt

One can choose to install via pypi: "python3 -m pip install pyhalo".

Features
--------
The purpose of this code is to quickly render full populations of dark matter subhalos and line of sight halos for gravitational lensing simulations. pyHalo also transltes halo properties (mass, concentration, redshift, etc) into angular units for lensing computations with lenstronomy. Implemented dark matter models currently include:

1) cold dark matter

Other useful features:

1) customizeable mass-concentration relations and flexible parameterization of the halo mass function with variable normalizations and logarithmic slopes (see, for example,  https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.3163G/abstract)

2) a variety of tidal stripping modules designed to predict the bound subhalo mass function given the infall subhalo mass function

3) automatic calculation of negative sheets of convergence along the line of sight to keep the mean density of the Universe equal to the critical density after adding halos

4) different geometries for rendering line-of-sight halos, ranging from a cylindrical volume to a double-cone configuration that opens towards the lens and closes towards the source.

5) correlated structure around the main deflector arising from the two-halo term (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.487.5721G/abstract, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.6064L/abstract)

pyHalo currently supports a variety of halo mass profiles, including Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles, truncated (NFW) profiles, cored power-law (PL) profiles, double PL profiles with variable inner and outer logarithmic slopes, cored NFW profiles, and point masses.
